      .hsn       ::= <lsn><tnsub>(<trssub><plsmap>*)*
      tnsub     ::= tnum
      trssub    ::= ht np <subnet>
      plsmap  ::= hp  lp

Notes:
       <lsn> is low-level net specification according to .lsn,
       'tnum' is total number of substituted transitions
       'ht' is high-level transition number, 'np' is number of place mappings,<subnet> is low-level net file name. 
       'hp' is high-level place number, 
       'lp' is low-level place number,
	1) If hp > 0, lp > 0, data input place mapping,
	2) If hp > 0, lp < 0, data output place mapping, 
	3) If hp < 0, lp > 0, start-control-ﬂow place mapping,
