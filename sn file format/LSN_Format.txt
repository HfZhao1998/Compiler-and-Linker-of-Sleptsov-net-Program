NAME
       LSN_format   - file formats of the LSN (low-level net)

Grammar:

         .lsn              ::= <pl><tr><arc><token>*<at>*
          pl               ::= m
          tr                ::= n
         arc               ::= k
         token           ::=mu
         at                 ::= v1 v2 w
           
Notes:
      'm' is number of places,
      'n' is number of transitions, 
      'k' is number of arcs,
      'mu' is token of each place,
      'at' is arc type:
     	 1) If v1 < 0, v2 < 0, arc from transition v1 to transition v2. It is a priority arc with w = 0.
     	 2) If v1 > 0, v2 > 0, arc from place v1 to transition v2 of multiplicity w.
     	 3) If v1 < 0, v2 > 0, arc from transition v2 to place |v1| of multiplicity w.
     	 4) When w is negative, it is inhibitor arc.
